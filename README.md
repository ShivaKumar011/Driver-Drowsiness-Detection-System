# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
This system detects the drowsiness of the driver by observing the movements of his/her eyes. It will ring an alarm once the eyes of the driver remain closed for more than the predetermined amount of time.  The main objective of this project is to reduce road accidents.

## Introduction
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a major project that I developed as part of my final semester. It is designed to detect the drowsiness of a driver by observing the movements of their eyes, aiming to reduce the risk of road accidents caused by driver fatigue or drowsiness. Once the system detects that the driver's eyes remain closed for more than the predetermined amount of time, an alarm is triggered, alerting the driver to stay alert and focused on the road.

## Purpose
The main objective of this project is to contribute to road safety by addressing the issue of driver drowsiness. By using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system can accurately analyze the driver's eye movements and identify signs of drowsiness. The timely alert provided by the system can help prevent accidents and save lives.

## Dataset
For training and testing the drowsiness detection model, I utilized the MRL dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasadvpatil/mrl-dataset). This dataset contains a comprehensive collection of eye images that are essential for developing an accurate and reliable model.

## Trained Model
I have trained a drowsiness detection model using the provided dataset. The trained model has achieved good performance in detecting driver drowsiness. The model can be downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19DgSvsteciBN6CdElC5cjpDE81nmN1e4?usp=sharing).

## Installation and Usage
